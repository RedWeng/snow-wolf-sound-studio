# Bug Fix Summary - 2026-02-04

## Issues Reported
1. 首頁最下面圖還是掉 (Hero section background image still missing on homepage)
2. 選完課程出現"尚未選擇課程" (After selecting a session, shows "No session selected" error)

## Root Causes

### Issue 1: Missing Hero Background Image
**Root Cause**: Image path mismatch in configuration file
- Config file (`lib/config/images.ts`) was pointing to `/image2/hero-main.png`
- Actual file name is `/image2/課程資訊HERO圖.png`
- The homepage (`app/page.tsx`) uses `images.hero.main` from the config

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `lib/config/images.ts` to use correct filename: `/image2/課程資訊HERO圖.png`
- Also fixed missing session images:
  - `session2`: Changed from `動畫配音場.png` to `SNOWWOLFBOY_卡達爾之戰.png`
  - `session4`: Changed from `時空冒險.jpg` to `RPG_古神殿之謎.png`

### Issue 2: "尚未選擇課程" Error
**Analysis**: This is likely a user flow misunderstanding, not a bug.

**Current User Flow**:
1. User visits homepage (`/`) - Pure landing page with full-screen images
2. User clicks "為孩子選擇聲音冒險" button → Redirects to `/login`
3. After login → Automatically redirects to `/sessions` page
4. On `/sessions` page → User can select sessions and add to cart
5. Click "加入冒險行列" → Items added to cart
6. Click cart icon or "完成報名" → Go to checkout

**Possible User Confusion**:
- The homepage (`/`) does NOT have session selection functionality
- Users must go through login → sessions page flow
- If user sees "尚未選擇課程", they may be:
  - Trying to interact with homepage images (which are not clickable sessions)
  - Not following the correct flow through login → sessions

**No Code Changes Needed**: The flow is working as designed. User education may be needed.

## Files Modified
1. `lib/config/images.ts` - Fixed hero and session image paths

## Deployment
- Deployed to production via Vercel CLI
- Production URL: https://snow-wolf-sound-studio.vercel.app
- Deployment completed successfully

## Testing Recommendations
1. Visit homepage and verify hero background image loads correctly
2. Follow complete user flow:
   - Homepage → Click button → Login → Sessions page → Select session → Add to cart
3. Verify all session card images load correctly on sessions page

## Notes
- All image files verified to exist in `public/image2/` directory
- Hero image file confirmed: `課程資訊HERO圖.png` ✓
- Session images updated to use available files
